*Loading in the data set*
```{r}
library(curl)
file <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/refs/heads/master/AN588_Spring25/zombies.csv")

# Problem 1 
Calculate the population mean and standard deviation for each quantitative random variable (height, weight, age, number of zombies killed, and years of education). NOTE: You will not want to use the built in var() and sd() commands as these are for samples.
```{r}
#viewing dataset so I know the variable names
View(zombies)

#function for calculating population standard deviation
pop_SD <- function(data) {
  sqrt(sum((data - mean(data))^2)/(length(data)))
}

#height
print(mean(zombies$height))
print(pop_SD(zombies$height))

#weight
print(mean(zombies$weight))
print(pop_SD(zombies$weight))

#age
print(mean(zombies$age))
print(pop_SD(zombies$age))

#number of zombies killed
print(mean(zombies$zombies_killed))
print(pop_SD(zombies$zombies_killed))

#years of education
print(mean(zombies$years_of_education))
print(pop_SD(zombies$years_of_education))

```

# Problem 2
Use {ggplot} to make boxplots of each of these variables by gender.
```{r}
library(ggplot2)

#height
heightVgender_Box <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
print(heightVgender_Box)

#weight
weightVgender_Box <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = weight, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
print(weightVgender_Box)

#age
ageVgender_Box <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = age, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
print(ageVgender_Box)

#number of zombies killed
killsVgender_Box <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = zombies_killed, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
print(killsVgender_Box)

#years of education 
educationVgender_Box <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = gender, y = years_of_education, fill = gender)) + geom_boxplot()
print(educationVgender_Box)
```

# Problem 3
Use {ggplot} to make scatter plots of height and weight in relation to age. Do these variables seem to be related? In what way?
```{r}
#height and age relation scatterplot
heightAge_scatter <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = age, y = height)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
heightAge_scatter

#weight and age relation scatterplot
weightAge_scatter <- ggplot(data = zombies, aes(x = age, y = weight)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
weightAge_scatter

print("Both height and weight seem to be positively correlated with age, though height seems to have a stronger correlation.")



```

# Problem 4
Using histograms and Q-Q plots, check whether the quantitative variables seem to be drawn from a normal distribution. Which seem to be and which do not (hint: not all are drawn from the normal distribution)? For those that are not normal, can you determine from which common distribution they are drawn?
```{r}
#height
hist(zombies$height)
qqnorm(zombies$height)
qqline(zombies$height, col = "blue")
print("Based on the histogram and the Q-Q plot, height seems to be normally distributed.")

#weight
hist(zombies$weight)
qqnorm(zombies$weight)
qqline(zombies$weight, col = "blue")
print("Based on the histogram and the Q-Q plot, weight seems to be normally distributed.")

#age
hist(zombies$age)
qqnorm(zombies$age)
qqline(zombies$age, col = "blue")
print("Based on the histogram and the Q-Q plot, age seems to be normally distributed.")

#zombie kills
hist(zombies$zombies_killed)
qqnorm(zombies$zombies_killed)
qqline(zombies$zombies_killed, col = "blue")
print("The histogram is heavily right-skewed, and the Q-Q plot does not fall on the line. Zombies killed is not normally distributed. Because the number of kills is count data which could take on a value between 0 and infinity, this is likely from a poisson distribution.")

#years of education 
hist(zombies$years_of_education)
qqnorm(zombies$years_of_education)
qqline(zombies$years_of_education, col = "blue")
print("The histogram is right-skewed, and the Q-Q plot does not fall on the line. Years of education is not normally distributed. Because the number of kills is count data which could take on a value between 0 and infinity, this is likely also from a poisson distribution.")


```

# Problem 5
Now use the sample() function to sample ONE subset of 30 zombie survivors (without replacement) from this population and calculate the mean and sample standard deviation for each variable. Also estimate the standard error for each variable, and construct the 95% confidence interval for each mean. Note that for the variables that are not drawn from the normal distribution, you may need to base your estimate of the CIs on slightly different code than for the normalâ€¦
```{r}
#First, create a subset of 30 random survivors
set.seed(1) #so it doesn't change every time
randomSurvivors_30 <- zombies[sample(nrow(zombies), 30), ] #selects 30 random rows out of the dataset, and chooses those rows (which are each survivors with all of their data)
randomSurvivors_30


#HEIGHT (normal)
rs30_mean_height <- mean(randomSurvivors_30$height) #calculates mean height

qnorm(0.975) #the critical value for a normal distribution (which is symmetrical) when alpha is 0.05 (95% confidence) and the sample is greater than or equal to 30

rs30_CIlower_height <- rs30_mean_height - (rs30_se_height*qnorm(0.975)) #calculates CI lower limit
cat("The mean height is",rs30_mean_height,". The standard deviation for height is",rs30_sd_height, ".The standard error for height is",rs30_se_height, ".The 95% confidence interval for the mean of the height is (",rs30_CIlower_height,",", rs30_CIupper_height,").")

# Problem 6
Now draw 99 more random samples of 30 zombie apocalypse survivors, and calculate the mean for each variable for each of these samples. Together with the first sample you drew, you now have a set of 100 means for each variable (each based on 30 observations), which constitutes a sampling distribution for each variable. What are the means and standard deviations of this distribution of means for each variable? How do the standard deviations of means compare to the standard errors estimated in [5]? What do these sampling distributions look like (a graph might help here)? Are they normally distributed? What about for those variables that you concluded were not originally drawn from a normal distribution?

# Challenges
1. printing/concatenating characters with numerics, but i found the cat function!
1. problem 5, couldn't get the sample function to work properly with the dataset. 
3. don't fully understand why we would replace when bootstrapping
